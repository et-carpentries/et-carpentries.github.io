Our main activity is teaching [Software](https://software-carpentry.org/) and [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/) workshops. 

The cost for these 2-day workshops is 1000 Birr (as of 2018), of which about 600 Birr goes towards food and drink (lunch and breaks). The rest is used for organizational logistics and the occasional [travel award]({{ site.baseurl }}/awards/). Our instructors, workshop members, and board all serve on a volunteer basis.

Most workshops use lesson materials from the Carpentries. These are designed to
provide novice users with a foundation to continue learning on their own,
with their peers, or more formally in coursework. As part of the UF community, 
we also strive to connect our learners with other opportunites for learning 
programming and data analysis on campus.
